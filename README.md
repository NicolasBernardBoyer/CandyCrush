 Assignment for Introduction to Game Development

 This is a simple match 3 type game with a Final Fantasy coat of paint.

 The goal of the game is to accumulate points by making horizontal and/or vertical matches of 3 or more materia orbs.
 The player has a limited amount of moves and must make 3 or more matches of each color to win within a time limit.
 If the player runs out of moves, or runs out of time, they lose.

 When a match is made, additional orbs are randomly spawned and placed at the empty spots on the board.

 Both levels are identical. 2 Levels are present for the sake of the functionality of the assignment.
